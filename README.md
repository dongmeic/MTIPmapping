# Steps
## Review existing data

The MTIP 21-24 projects are mapped [here](https://arcg.is/15rCGy). The spatial information was collected from multiple resources, including MTIP projects from 2018 to 2021, ODOT web maps and project tracker.

The new 21 projects on June 2020 need to be added in August 2020.

## Collect spatial information

Spatial information can be found on [this document](https://www.lcog.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Item/3168?fileID=11682). 
Contact agencies for existing shapefiles in the CLMPO 2022-2024 STBG/TA/CMAQ Candidate Project Summary. Identify whether spatial projects are lines and add coordinates to all spatial projects. Review the mapped and revised projects in ArcGIS Pro.

## Map the projects

The previous feature created as "MTIP_Lines" is saved in C:/Users/clid1852/Documents/ArcGIS/Projects/MTIP/MTIP.gdb. The last final version of the MTIP maps are saved as "Lines200428" (last revision time April 28th, 2020) and "Points200428" in G:/projects/Transportation/MTIP/MTIP_FY21-24.gdb.
